# `types` directory

This directory contains all manually exported types - for **external** contracts and contract function parameters.

NOTE: all **internal** contracts types will be generated by Typechain on compilation (before running tests).

## `contractParams.ts`

Place type definitions for all **complex types** in contract calls in this folder.
